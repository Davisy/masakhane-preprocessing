# Stopwords for African languages

This is a project to include stopwords for African languages in NLP. The importance of stopwords in NLP analysis cannot be over-emphasized.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository. We are interested in the `african-stopwords` folder. 
2. Go to the  `.txt` file of your language tag in the `languages` folder. Consult [LANGUAGE-TABLE.md](LANGUAGE-TABLE.md) for the tag of your language. If the file isn't there, please create one. 
3. Edit the file: add more stopwords for your language or delete the wrong ones.
4. Submit your pull request for merging.

Alternatively,

5. If there are websites with african stopwords, please indicate (via an issue or Slack).
 
## Plan
Open to suggestions, for now I think we can:

1. Compile a good list of african stopwords and make a feature request to have it added on [nltk](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).
